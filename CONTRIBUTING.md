## Contributing

To add your own gallery you will need to fork this repo and modify the right files.

First find a good "slug" for your gallery (see gallerys/list.json5) and add it to the bottom of the list.

It could be something like "johndoe" just try to keep "extension" or "gallery" out of the name.

Then create a JSON5 file in the same directory with the same "slug". (see gallerys/surv.json5 for help).

Then you are basically done, so just submit a PR and I will review it!

#### Adding an image

You may notice that you can have an image, and that is correct!

Just add your image to static/thumbs (make sure you are allowed to use it!) and make sure its a WEBP file!

The name should be the same as the "slug" you chose before.
